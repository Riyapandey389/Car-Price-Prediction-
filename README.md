#Car Price Prediction Model ðŸš—ðŸ’°

Overview
This project is a Car Price Prediction Machine Learning Model built using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The model predicts the selling price of cars based on key attributes such as Driven Kilometers (Mileage), Fuel Type, and Selling Price. The dataset used for this project is from CASL (Car Price Prediction Dataset).


#Dataset
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction
The dataset contains the following features:


Car Name
Year
Selling Price (Target Variable)
Present Price
Driven Kilometers (Mileage)
Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
Selling Type (Dealer/Individual)
Transmission (Manual/Automatic)
Owner (First/Second/Third Owner)


#For model training, we used:

Driven Kilometers (Mileage)
Fuel Type
Selling Price




#Technologies Used-:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (for ML Model Training)
Jupyter Notebook
